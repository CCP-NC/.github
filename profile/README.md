# CCP-NC

## About

CCP-NC supports a multidisciplinary community of NMR spectroscopists, crystallographers, materials modellers and application scientists by developing and integrating software across the area of NMR crystallography. This is an emerging field, [recently recognised by the International Union of Crystallography](https://www.iucr.org/iucr/commissions/nmr-crystallography), defined as the combined use of experimental NMR and computation to provide new insight, with atomic resolution, into structure, disorder, and dynamics in the solid state.


Support for the research community includes, but is not limited to:

* development of data processing and visualisation tools
* enabling the use of state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations
* training and practical support for ab initio calculation of NMR parameters
* HPC access

The CCP-NC community consists of academic and industrial research groups from across the United Kingdom, supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The CCP-NC is funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant: EP/T026642/1 (previous grants: EP/J010510/1 and EP/M022501/1).
